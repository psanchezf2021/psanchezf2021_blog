Firstly I started by converting the GPS locations to UTM. The ressults were the safety boat located at 430492 East 4459162 North and the survivors at 430532 East 4459132. By substracting the boat coordinates (origin) to the survivor coordinates (target) i obtained the position of the survivors on the simulated map: 40, -30.
